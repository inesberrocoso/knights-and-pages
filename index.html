    <h2> Problem solving</h2>
<section id="bloctexte">    <p> Many years ago, three knights waited to cross the river Neva. Each knight had his own page, so there were six people.
    The boat that they had could only carry two.

  However the knights were ferocious killers and the three pages were terrifield. In fact, it was certain that any of the pages would die of heart failure if he were not protected at every instant from the other knights by the presnce of his own master.

Was there any way to cross everyone over the river without losing a page? </p></section></section>
